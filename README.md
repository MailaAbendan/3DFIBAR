# 3DFIBAR Animation Generator

Welcome to the 3DFIBAR Animation Generator! This tool allows you to transform your storyboarding video animations into 3D animations using a simple command prompt interface.

## How to Use

1. Open the 3DFIBAR command prompt.
2. You will be prompted with the message: `WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GENERATE`.
3. Type the name of the file you want to generate. If it is the same file name as your storyboarding video animation, the command prompt will say: `Alright, I will generate the animation into a 3D`.

## Generating Animation

1. The command prompt will start generating the animation with a progress count (e.g., `generating (1/3000)`).
2. Wait until the generation is complete. The process may take some time, so please be patient.
3. Once done, the generated animation will be saved as `VideoTest1.mp4` and placed on your desktop.

## Enjoy

After the generation is complete, you can find the `VideoTest1.mp4` file on your desktop. Open it to enjoy your new 3D animation!

## Notes

- Ensure that your storyboarding video animation file is in the correct format and located in the appropriate directory for the tool to access it.
- The generated file will overwrite any existing file with the same name, so make sure to back up your original files if needed.
